What I understand about the project:
-Admin.scss has styling of general button and backend components
-App.js is the main app component in REACT which acts as a container for all other components
-Diologue section 
    -gives unique variables to requirements in a new document
    -syncing and pushing to firebase (with error checking)
    -ensures deletion of a document
    -makes sure requirements are shown to the user during upload with proper styling
Login section
    -lets user type in their info
    -captures errors during authentation proc
    -uses firebase authentication to verify user in the system by checking email and password
AdminBase section
-lets info go to the local storage if login is successful
-removes info when logging out
What I don't understand about the project:
-The constructor method:
    -What info is the parent component and whata info from the parent component is the child component?
-when I type in "npm start" I get all of these errors
    -not sure why bc it worked before
What I think can be improved:
- let the code run smoothly when typing in "npm start" in the terminal

Done -- AdminBase contians the ability to put a user in local storage
        so that can go with the other login stuff in login.js then delete
        adminbase.js for efficency and just organizatianlly from the dev standpoint


I believe Admin.js in the login folder can be made into a dialouge because it is a button function and render like 
delete and upload so could be moved and renamed

For all dialogs Tristan wants to move away from material-ui so we need to work in a new tool there 
for design, Log out button needs to be restyled along with the dialouges when we take out material-ui for uniformity and just overall style of the page

We need some type of error for a failed login, it just doesn't work and there is no indication of what went wrong
or if the site is just loading

The delete button from Delete.js is also still using the upload test functionallity so we need to seperate those so there is no criss-crossing
, so basically just make the functions seperate and make the buttons do what they're supposed to

Filter just doesn't do anything, as far as I can tell it is only styled right now so it should be given a .js file with the other 
dialouges 

An error message saying all fields are required should be added to the upload form because when you don't enter all the info and try to 
enter it nothing happens, but no reason is given to the user

There are some UI optins in DialogContainer that I don't think we need, they are not in use now and don't seem like buttons we'll need

Could use the addition of an info button as part of the UI with tutorial like info as like a here's what this is and what stuff does

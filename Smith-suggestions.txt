Done  -- AdminBase contians the ability to put a user in local storage
so that can go with the other login stuff in login.js then delete
adminbase.js for efficency and just organizatianlly from the dev standpoint


I believe Admin.js in the login folder can be made into a login because it is page render for the login

For all dialogs Tristan wants to move away from material-ui so we need to work in a new tool there 
for design

We need some type of error for a failed login, it just doesn't work and there is no indication of what went wrong
or if the site is just loading

The delete button from Delete.js is also still using the upload test functionallity so we need to seperate those so there is no criss-crossing
, so basically just make the functions seperate and make the buttons do what they're supposed to

Filter just doesn't do anything, as far as I can tell it is only styled right now so it should be given a .js file with the other 
dialouges
